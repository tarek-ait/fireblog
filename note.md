# the project setup
 ( we need to use an older version of node ) ( using the nvm, we can contorl the node version we want to use) , install node 14
- first we install the dependencies by running the command -- nmp install
- we use the command npm run serve to run the server on our local machine 
- the command npm run build for compilation
- and the command npm run lit for fixing fils 

# first 1 ( the setup , navigation bar and footer implementations ) 
running through the repo folder and it contents 
- creat a folder for the firebase implementation which has a firebaseInit.js file
- we wan use a vue dependency to let us export svgs as components , it is just a personal preference
- we run fidrebase and we create a new project, then we enable the servers we are gonna use such that the authentication, and enable the eimal/password sign int method. And then we enable firestore and we create a new database, we set to the test mode and we will come back to it at the end.
- we connect the front end to the backend by adding a web application, then we add the firebaseconfig the the firebaseinit and we import firebase and firebase firestore library to the file.


- creating the navigation {
    - how to the css nesting and the child properties
    - how to do animations using vue.js
    - the navigation will stay always at the top, without styling this part
    - how to do a slide is pretty easy and straight forward using vue.js (which can help us implement it in tresor on the top navigation with the transformY)
}

- creating the footer{
    - when we do a margin top auto the footer will always stays at the bottom, and when we do any add to the app it will push it to the bottom
    - the styoing is just a css which can be easily done (skipped that part)
    - we must notice that we are using the svgs as components using the vue-svg-loader on the package.json file 
}

- working on the home page 
  - the blogpost component 

# day 2 ( the fire blog component )
- starting in the day 3 where we will be creating the home page blog 
- so we will make the blog post component
